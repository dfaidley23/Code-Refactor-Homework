# Code-Refactor-Homework

## Description
This site was built with the intention of being an about the company site for the company Horiseon.

My motivation for refactoring this code was to meet the clients requests in having a more SAO and accessible website.
This project was built in order to achieve the goal of making the page meets the clients needs.
Now the website is more Accessible, meets more SAO standards, and the code has been cleaned up to reduce excess code and comments added so its easier to follow for any future changes.


## Installation
No installation is required as this is a web based project.

## Usage
This site is used for the company Horiseon as a main website for the company. It is a simple intro page to the company.

If you wish to download the code and make changes simply fork the repository to your repo or you can do a pull request.

Any future changes will only be made at the clients request and must be to either improve functionality, meet more SAO requirements, or make the site either more responsive or more accessible.


## Credits
The credits for this pages construction goes to the DU team for the original build and to myself for refactoring the code as per the clients needs.


## Tests

For tests since this is a simple website you could simply check that the links work and take you to the sections they display.

Also you could use Google Chromes lighthouse and generate a report to show the page accessibility and try to make it even better in the future. (currently this is at 100% in the lighthouse report)
